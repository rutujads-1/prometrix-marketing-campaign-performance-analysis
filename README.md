# prometrix-marketing-campaign-performance-analysis

## Project Background 

Prometrix Marketing is a fictitious marketing agency that partners with retail brands to design and deliver targeted campaigns. The dataset used in this project contains marketing campaign data for 2,240 customers, including customer profiles, product preferences, spending patterns, campaign performance, and channel engagement.

Taking on the role of a Data Analyst, I collaborated with the Campaign Strategy, Customer Insights, and Product Performance teams to analyze this data and uncover insights that drive smarter decision-making.

### Objectives of the project:

- Identify the most and least successful marketing campaigns.

- Understand what the average customer looks like and how they behave.

- Evaluate product performance and customer spending patterns.

- Assess channel performance to identify underperforming areas.


### Key KPIs

- Acceptance Rate
  
- Total spent

- Number of Buyers

- Averagr spend per buyer

### Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, KPI calculation, unpivoting, and analysis

- Power Query – Data reshaping, conditional column creation, and aggregation

- Pivot Tables & Charts – KPI computation, performance analysis, and visualization

- Data Visualization – Scatter plots, column charts, and pie charts to identify trends, outliers, and performance patterns


## Executive Summary


  

## Insights Deep Dive

### Marketing Campaign Analysis 

The sixth and most recent campaign was the most successful, achieving an acceptance rate of 14.88%, significantly outperforming all previous campaigns. It was followed by Campaign 4 with a 7.46% acceptance rate, while Campaigns 3 and 5 both recorded 7.28%. The least successful was Campaign 2, with an acceptance rate of just 1.34%, indicating minimal customer engagement.

When segmented by demographics, Campaign 6 consistently outperformed all others across every age group, while Campaign 2 remained the weakest performer across the board.

Breaking the results down by income levels highlights more nuanced patterns:

High-income customers: Campaigns 6 (23.37%) and 5 (21.60%) achieved nearly identical and strong performance.

Mid-income customers: Campaign 6 (10.15%) led, followed by Campaign 4 (8.39%), which performed comparatively well in this segment.

Low-income customers: Campaign 6 (11.32%) again outperformed, followed by Campaign 3 (8.29%).


While Campaign 6 demonstrated broad effectiveness across all customer groups, other campaigns showed segment-specific strengths — Campaign 5 with high-income customers, Campaign 4 with mid-income customers, and Campaign 3 with low-income customers. This suggests that future campaigns could benefit from targeted segmentation strategies tailored to income levels to maximize overall conversion rates.
