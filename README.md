## Executive Summary


  

## Insights Deep Dive

### Marketing Campaign Analysis 

The sixth and most recent campaign was the most successful, achieving an acceptance rate of 14.88%, significantly outperforming all previous campaigns. It was followed by Campaign 4 with a 7.46% acceptance rate, while Campaigns 3 and 5 both recorded 7.28%. The least successful was Campaign 2, with an acceptance rate of just 1.34%, indicating minimal customer engagement.

When segmented by demographics, Campaign 6 consistently outperformed all others across every age group, while Campaign 2 remained the weakest performer across the board.

Breaking the results down by income levels highlights more nuanced patterns:

High-income customers: Campaigns 6 (23.37%) and 5 (21.60%) achieved nearly identical and strong performance.

Mid-income customers: Campaign 6 (10.15%) led, followed by Campaign 4 (8.39%), which performed comparatively well in this segment.

Low-income customers: Campaign 6 (11.32%) again outperformed, followed by Campaign 3 (8.29%).


While Campaign 6 demonstrated broad effectiveness across all customer groups, other campaigns showed segment-specific strengths — Campaign 5 with high-income customers, Campaign 4 with mid-income customers, and Campaign 3 with low-income customers. This suggests that future campaigns could benefit from targeted segmentation strategies tailored to income levels to maximize overall conversion rates.


### Average Customer Profile

The typical customer is ~45 years old with an income of ~$52,240. Across the last two years, customers have spent $1,354,200 in total across product categories. About 33% fall in the mid-income range, 864 are married, and education levels are high—50.43% hold a graduate degree—pointing to a stable, educated customer base with solid purchasing power.

**Geographic Distribution**

Across the 3 years the customers joined, the customer base has been heavily concentrated in **Spain**, which accounts for nearly **49%** of all customers and contributes the largest share of spending ($660,367). This is followed by **Saudi Arabia (15.03%)** and **Canada (11.95%)**, which together make up another quarter of the customer base.

Other countries such as **Australia, India, Germany, and the USA represent smaller segments**(each under 8%), while Mexico shows minimal presence.

This indicates that Spain is the company’s core market, and strategies tailored to its customers will likely yield the greatest impact, while emerging markets may offer room for targeted growth.


**Income distribution over time**

The income profile of new customers shows both consistency and subtle shifts in engagement patterns over the three-year period.

**2012:** A total of 492 new customers joined, with mid-income individuals (161) forming the largest segment. They were closely followed by low-income (170) and high-income (161) customers, indicating a balanced acquisition profile across income levels in the early stage.

**2013:** Customer acquisition peaked across all income groups, led by mid-income customers (414). The low-income group (395) and high-income group (378) also saw significant growth, reflecting strong campaign effectiveness and broad market appeal during this period.

**2014:** Acquisition declined across all segments, with high-income customers (197) forming the largest group, followed by low-income (195) and mid-income (164) customers. The slowdown may suggest reduced campaign impact or market saturation, though the rising share of high-income customers hints at evolving engagement dynamics.

Mid-income customers remained the most consistently acquired segment throughout the three years, underscoring their status as a highly engaged and strategically valuable demographic. However, the noticeable growth in high-income customers by 2014 suggests a gradual shift in the customer composition toward more affluent segments — a trend that could influence future marketing and product positioning strategies.

**Age distribution over time**

The age distribution of newly acquired customers highlights a consistently strong presence of mid-career individuals, with the 30–59 age range dominating signups throughout the three years.

**2012:** The majority of new customers came from the 30–44 age group (181), followed by the 45–59 segment (155). Younger customers under 30 (76) and older customers over 60 (80) represented smaller portions of the new customer base but were still present in meaningful numbers.

**2013:** Customer acquisition peaked across all age groups, once again led by the 30–44 cohort (497), followed by 45–59 (397). Both younger customers under 30 (144) and older customers over 60 (149) reached their highest levels during this period, reflecting a broader expansion of the customer base.

**2014:** Although overall acquisition declined, the 30–44 age group (190) remained the largest segment, followed by 45–59 (144). Customers under 30 (48) and over 60 (74) continued to make up smaller shares of new signups.

Across all three years, the 30–59 age range consistently dominated new acquisitions, highlighting the company’s strong appeal to mid-career individuals with higher purchasing power and stable income. This demographic represents a strategically important target group for future marketing and retention efforts.

**Education trends over time**

The customer base has consistently been highly educated, and this trend has strengthened over the three-year period.

**2012:** A total of 492 new customers joined, with the majority holding a graduate degree (249). Customers with a Master’s degree (117) and PhD (105) also formed significant portions of the base, while only 21 had basic education. This indicates that from the outset, the company attracted a well-educated audience.

**2013:** Customer acquisition surged to 1,187, and graduates remained the largest group (604), followed by those with a Master’s degree (317) and PhDs (242). The number of customers with only basic education declined further (24), reinforcing the company’s strong appeal among higher-educated segments.

**2014:** Although total acquisition fell to 556, the customer base remained highly qualified. The proportion of PhD holders (136) was nearly equal to that of Master’s graduates (137), indicating a continued shift toward an even more highly educated profile despite the slowdown in total new customers.

Across all three years, customers with graduate or higher degrees consistently dominated new acquisitions. The sustained presence of Master’s and PhD holders highlights the company’s strong resonance with an educated audience — suggesting that products and campaigns are particularly attractive to individuals with advanced qualifications.

**Marital Status Trends over time**

The marital status profile of new customers shows a consistent dominance of household-oriented segments, with married individuals forming the largest group across all three years.

**2012:** A total of 691 new customers joined, with married individuals (189) representing the largest share. They were followed by those living together (127) and single customers (106). Smaller segments included divorced (48) and widowed (21) customers. These figures suggest that household-oriented customers were a significant part of the customer base from the outset.

**2013:** Customer acquisition peaked at 1,187 new customers. Married individuals (452) continued to dominate, while the living together group grew significantly to 314, and single customers (253) also formed a notable portion of new signups. The divorced (131) and widowed (37) segments expanded too, reflecting broader engagement across different household structures during this high-growth year.

**2014:** Acquisition slowed to 555 new customers, but married customers (223) still formed the largest group, followed by those living together (138) and single customers (123). The divorced (52) and widowed (19) groups remained smaller but stable. Despite the slowdown in overall acquisition, the trend of household-oriented customers being the most responsive segment persisted.

Married and cohabiting customers consistently represent the largest share of new acquisitions, highlighting the importance of household dynamics in shaping purchasing decisions. Targeting these segments with tailored messaging and offers could strengthen customer engagement and retention.


**Customer Activity and Engagement Patterns**

An analysis of customer activity reveals that the company’s customer base is heavily composed of Established customers, though their engagement levels vary significantly. The largest segments are Established–Active (381) and Established–Dormant (366), indicating that while many customers have maintained a long-term relationship with the company, not all remain consistently engaged.

**Active Customers (721):** This group forms the largest share of the base, with most being Established rather than New or Loyal. Their presence suggests a stable core of customers with ongoing engagement, though there is room to deepen loyalty and increase activity levels.

**Dormant Customers (664):** Primarily Established customers, this group represents a significant portion of the customer base that is at risk of disengagement. Re-engagement strategies targeting this segment could yield substantial returns.

**Warm Customers (653):** A mix of Established and New customers, this segment shows potential for increased engagement. With the right campaigns and incentives, many of these customers could transition into active or loyal segments.

**Lost Customers (197):** Although the smallest group, these are mostly long-term customers who have stopped engaging, indicating a degree of churn. Analyzing their behavior could provide insights into retention challenges.

While the company benefits from a strong base of Established customers, the variation in engagement levels highlights key opportunities. Reviving Dormant and Warm segments through targeted reactivation efforts and nurturing new customers toward loyalty could significantly improve retention and lifetime value.


### Product Performance Analysis

Product performance is highly concentrated in **Wines and Meat Products**, which dominate both total spending and customer value. Wines lead all categories with a total spending of **$679,394** and an **average spend per buyer of $305.76**, establishing them as the company’s most valuable and high-yield product line. **Meat Products** follow as the **second-strongest category**, generating **$373,293 in total spending** with a large buyer base of 2,234 customers and an **average spend of $167.10**, underscoring their significant contribution to overall performance.

While **Gold Products** contribute a comparatively modest **$98,274 in total spending**, they attract a **substantial customer base of 2,174 buyers** — nearly as many as Wines and Meat. However, the **average spend per buyer is only $45.20**, suggesting strong engagement but lower individual transaction sizes. This indicates an opportunity to increase revenue per customer through upselling, premium product positioning, or bundling strategies.

Other categories, such as **Fish Products, Fruits, and Sweet Products, lag behind in both total spending and customer value**, contributing less than $85,000 each with average spends ranging between $32 and $45. These underperforming segments currently add limited revenue impact and may require targeted marketing initiatives, product differentiation, or strategic bundling to enhance their performance and customer appeal.

**Country wise Analysis**

**Spain**

In Spain, total customer spending over the last two years is heavily concentrated in Wines and Meat Products, which together account for nearly 78% of total revenue. Wines lead the market with $337,236 (51.1%), followed by Meat Products at $178,480 (27.0%). Mid-tier categories include Gold Products ($46,038, 7.0%) and Fish Products ($40,161, 6.1%), while Sweets ($30,150, 4.6%) and Fruits ($28,302, 4.3%) contribute smaller shares.

Both Wines and Meat Products reach similarly wide audiences — with 1,088 and 1,093 customers respectively — yet Wines significantly outperform Meat in terms of customer value, generating an average spend of approximately $310 per buyer compared to Meat’s $163. This difference highlights Wines as the company’s most lucrative product line in the Spanish market, nearly doubling revenue despite similar customer reach.

Among lower-performing categories, Fish Products stand out slightly with higher total spending than Fruits and Sweets. Additionally, both Gold and Fish Products attract relatively large buyer bases (1,065 buyers for Gold) but yield lower average spend per customer, indicating strong customer interest but smaller transaction sizes. These categories may offer opportunities for upselling or product bundling to boost per-customer revenue.

**Age wise spending**

Buyer counts are relatively close within each age group (e.g., 30–44: 449 wine vs. 452 meat; 45–59: 389 vs. 390), so revenue differences are primarily driven by average spend per buyer rather than reach.
Wines consistently show higher average spend across all age bands, and the spend increases with age:

<30: $246

30–44: $247

45–59: $368

60+: $396

This explains why the 45–59 group delivers the most wine revenue ($143,053), and the 60+ segment generates $57,488 from just 145 buyers, highlighting them as a high-value niche despite smaller reach.

Meat Products show lower and flatter averages:
<30: $199

30–44: $132

45–59: $170

60+: $215

The 30–44 segment drives the most meat revenue ($59,825) purely through volume (452 buyers), but their low ticket size ($132) limits total revenue potential.


**Value segments:** 45+ (especially 60+ wine) — fewer buyers but very high average spend → focus on expanding reach.


**Volume but low value:** 30–44 (both categories, especially meat) — high reach but low spend per buyer → target with upsell/cross-sell strategies.


**Younger (<30):** small reach; moderate value in meat vs. wine → lower strategic priority.

**Saudi Arabia**

Customer spending in Saudi Arabia reveals a clear preference for Wines and Meat Products, which together make up the majority of total revenue. Wines lead the market with $105,910 in total spending from 334 buyers, translating to an impressive average spend of $317.10 per customer. Meat Products follow as the second most significant category, generating $58,393 from 336 buyers with an average spend of $173.79.

Despite having a buyer base nearly identical in size, Wines deliver almost double the revenue per customer compared to Meat Products — highlighting strong willingness to pay and positioning Wines as a premium, high-value product segment with substantial revenue potential.

Lower-performing categories such as Fish Products ($13,663 from 272 buyers) and Gold Products ($15,127 from 329 buyers) demonstrate moderate customer engagement but significantly lower average spend per buyer, suggesting opportunities for upselling, premium packaging, or repositioning strategies. Meanwhile, Sweet Products and Fruits trail behind in both total revenue and customer value, reflecting limited investment and lower consumer priority in these segments.

**Age wise spending**

Buyer counts are matched within each age group (e.g., 30–44: 135 wine vs 135 meat; 45–59: 113 vs 113), so revenue differences are driven by average spend, not reach.

Wines have the higher average spend in every age band and it rises with age: 

- $285 (<30) → $260 (30–44) → $338 (45–59) → $455 (60+).

That’s why 45–59 wines deliver the most revenue ($38,187), and 60+ wines generate $21,852 from only 48 buyers—a very high-value niche.

Meat averages are lower and flatter:

- $247 (<30) → $161 (30–44) → $154 (45–59) → $196 (60+).


30–44 meat has the largest revenue ($21,711) purely on volume (135 buyers) but shows a low ticket size ($161).

- **Value segment:** 45+ (especially 60+ wine) — few buyers, very high avg spend → expand reach.

- **Volume but low value:** 30–44 (both categories, especially meat) → upsell/cross-sell to lift ticket size.
  
- **Younger (<30):** small reach; moderate value in meat vs wine → lower priority.


**Canada**

In Canada,  again customer spending is heavily concentrated in Wines and Meat Products, which together account for nearly 80% of the country’s total revenue. Wines lead with $84,327 (51.4%), followed by Meat Products with $46,098 (28.1%), underscoring their dominance in the product portfolio. The next tier consists of Gold Products ($12,241, 7.5%) and Fish Products ($10,024, 6.1%), while Fruits ($7,743, 4.7%) and Sweet Products ($7,675, 4.7%) remain the smallest contributors.

Buyer reach is relatively consistent across top categories, with Meat (267 buyers) and Wines (266 buyers) attracting nearly identical customer counts, followed closely by Gold (256 buyers). Despite this similar reach, Wines generate significantly higher revenue per customer, with an average spend of $317 compared to $172 for Meat, highlighting the premium value and revenue efficiency of the wine category.

Among lower-performing segments, Gold and Fish Products demonstrate notable buyer engagement but a lower average spend, suggesting frequent but smaller purchases and potential opportunities for upselling or product bundling. Meanwhile, Fruits and Sweet Products, despite comparable buyer reach, contribute minimally to total revenue, reflecting their limited strategic impact and indicating a need for targeted interventions to boost their performance.

**Age wise spending**

Buyer counts are closely matched within each age group (e.g., 30–44: 116 wine vs. 117 meat; 45–59: 99 vs. 99), indicating that average spend per buyer is the key driver of revenue differences.

Wines show consistently higher average spend across all age segments and rise notably with age:

<30: $378

30–44: $259

45–59: $350

60+: $390

The 45–59 segment delivers the highest wine revenue ($34,603), while the 60+ group generates $12,872 from just 33 buyers, demonstrating strong per-customer value despite a small base. Even the youngest group (<30) spends significantly more per buyer on wine than on meat.

Meat Products, while maintaining similar reach, have much lower average spend across all age groups:

<30: $309

30–44: $147

45–59: $179

60+: $171


The 30–44 and 45–59 segments contribute the most meat revenue ($17,202 and $17,693, respectively) due to volume, but both show limited per-buyer value.


**High-value segments:** 45+ (especially 60+ wine) — smaller reach but exceptionally high average spend → focus on expanding reach.


**Volume but low ticket size:** 30–44 and 45–59 for meat — broad reach but low per-buyer value → consider upselling premium meat products.


**Younger (<30):** small segment but surprisingly strong per-buyer spend on both wine and meat → potential for early brand loyalty strategies.

### Channel Performance 

**Purchase Volume**

Customer purchase behavior is overwhelmingly dominated by in-store transactions, which account for 12,950 purchases, firmly establishing physical stores as the company’s most utilized sales channel. The web channel follows with 9,129 purchases, reflecting strong digital engagement and highlighting the growing importance of online sales, though it still trails behind traditional retail. Catalog purchases remain the least preferred option, with 5,954 transactions, representing less than half the volume of in-store purchases.

This distribution indicates that while traditional retail remains the primary driver of sales, online channels are playing a significant role and represent a substantial portion of overall transactions. The notably lower use of catalog purchases suggests this channel is underperforming and may require strategic reassessment — either optimization or reallocation of resources.


**Buyers and Engagement**

Buyers by Channel:

Store: 2,220 buyers

Web: 2,186 buyers

Catalog: 1,650 buyers

Store and Web have comparable reach, highlighting strong adoption of both physical and digital channels. In contrast, the Catalog channel has the smallest buyer base, pointing to limited reach and engagement potential.


**Engagement (purchases per buyer)**

 Using your totals (Store 12,950, Web 9,129, Catalog 5,954):


Store: 12,950 / 2,220 ≈ 5.84 purchases per buyer


Web: 9,129 / 2,186 ≈ 4.18 purchases per buyer


Catalog: 5,954 / 1,650 ≈ 3.61 purchases per buyer


- Store leads on both reach and frequency, with nearly 6 purchases per buyer on average.

- Web has a similar reach but a lower engagement level.

- Catalog significantly underperforms on both metrics, indicating low repeat purchase behavior and a potential need for targeted improvement or repositioning.
